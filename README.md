# DeepSpace2019
The Radicubs FRC code for the Destination: Deep Space 2019 challenge

For the 2019 FRC competition, we pushed ourselves and created an arcade drive robot. In addition, we were able to construct a line adjusting subsystem using a PixyCam2 and Arduino to make our robot move autonomously when picking and placing the hatch panel game objects. Moreover, subsystems were also created for pneumatic systems and the ultrasonic sensor.
