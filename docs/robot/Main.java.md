# `Main.java`

This code is the code that runs everything else. In `public static void main` of class `Main`,
we create a new `Robot` (as defined in Robot.java). We then run `RobotBase.startRobot, passing
in our `Robot` object as our arg.

RobotBase is located at `import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.RobotBase`. Documentation for RobotBase
can be found (here)[https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/beta/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/RobotBase.html].

Generally, don't mess with this file unless you know what you are doing.
